Kubewarden is an open-source CNCF project actively engaged with the wider
Kubernetes ecosystem. This informs the use of valuable projects like Policy
Reporter. Using [Policy
Reporter](https://docs.kubewarden.io/explanations/audit-scanner/policy-reports#policy-reporter-ui)
as a default UI for Kubewarden simplifies the user experience, allowing the use
of familiar reporting mechanisms. This strategic choice also lets the team
concentrate on the Kubewarden core stack.

So, the Kubewarden team participates in the [Kubernetes Policy Working
Group](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/wg-policy/README.md).
We join community meetings and seek opportunities for collaboration, focusing
on the future of policy reporting and related resources. The community moved
policy reporting to an independent project, the
[OpenReports](https://openreports.io/) project!

Inspired by OpenTelemetry's unifying approach to metrics and traces, the
OpenReports project provides an API for creating and consuming reports in the
Kubernetes ecosystem. This benefits Kubewarden and other projects. Kubewarden
has been involved since the beginning of OpenReports, and we will continue to
help the community build a robust, integrated ecosystem.

You can learn more about OpenReports in the [official project
announcement](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2025/05/06/announcing-openreports-standardized-kubernetes-reporting/)!
