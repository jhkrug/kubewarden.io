title:  Keeping track of Kubernetes deprecated resources

It's fact of life: as the Kubernetes API evolves, it's periodically reorganized
or upgraded. This means some Kubernetes resources can be [deprecated and later removed](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/deprecation-policy/#deprecating-parts-of-the-api).

We deserve to easily keep track of those deprecations and removals. For that, we
have just released
the [deprecated-api-versions policy](https://github.com/kubewarden/deprecated-api-versions-policy/).

### A look at the deprecated-api-versions policy

This policy detects the usage of Kubernetes resources that have been deprecated
or removed from the Kubernetes API.

The policy has two settings:

- `kubernetes_version`: The starting version from where to detect deprecated or
  removed Kubernetes resources. This setting is mandatory.
- `deny_on_deprecation:` If true, it will deny the operation on a resource
  that has been deprecated but not yet removed from the Kubernetes version
  specified by `kubernetes_version`. This setting is optional, it is set to `true` by default.

As an example, `extensions/v1beta1/Ingress` was deprecated in Kubernetes
`1.14.0`, and removed in `v1.22.0`.

With the following policy settings, an `extensions/v1beta1/Ingress` will be
accepted in the cluster yet the policy would log its result:

```yaml
kubernetes_version: "1.19.0"
deny_on_deprecation: false
```

In contrast, with these other settings, the Ingress object would be blocked:

```yaml
kubernetes_version: "1.19.0"
deny_on_deprecation: true # (the default)
```

### Don't live in the past

Kubernetes deprecations evolve; as soon as there are new deprecations, the
policy will be updated.

The policy versioning scheme tells you up to what version of Kubernetes the
policy knows about, e.g. `0.1.0-k8sv1.26.0` means that the policy knows about
deprecations up to Kubernetes `v1.26.0`.

### Back to the future

You are updating your cluster's Kubernetes version, and want to know if you will
be in trouble because of deprecated or removed resources in the new version?

Check before updating! Just instantiate the deprecated-api-versions policy with
the targeted Kubernetes version and `deny_on_deprecation` set to false, and get
an overview of future-you problems.

### In action

As usual, instantiate a `ClusterAdmissionPolicy` (cluster-wide) or
`AdmissionPolicy` (namespaced) that makes use of the policy.

For this example, let's work in a k8s cluster of version `1.24.0`.

Here's a definition of a cluster-wide policy that rejects resources that were
deprecated or removed in Kubernetes version `1.23.0` and earlier:

```yaml
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: policies.kubewarden.io/v1
kind: ClusterAdmissionPolicy
metadata:
  name: my-deprecated-api-versions-policy
spec:
  module: ghcr.io/kubewarden/policies/deprecated-api-versions:v0.1.0-k8sv1.26.0
  mutating: false
  rules:
  - apiGroups: ["*"]
    apiVersions: ["*"]
    resources: ["*"]
    operations:
    - CREATE
    - UPDATE
  settings:
    kubernetes_version: "1.23.0"
    deny_on_deprecation: true
EOF
```

> **Info:** In `spec.rules` we are checking every resource in every
> apiGroup and apiVersions. We are doing it for simplicity in this example, yet
> the policy
[metadata.yaml](https://github.com/kubewarden/deprecated-api-versions-policy/blob/b26633515de367cf77b79fb909461a4df6e0e2aa/metadata.yml)
> comes with long and complete, machine-generated `spec.rules` that covers just
> the resources that are deprecated.
>
> You can obtain the right rules by using the `kwctl scaffold` command.

Our cluster is on version `1.24.0`, so for example, without the policy we could
still instantiate an `autoscaling/v2beta2/HorizontalPodAutoscaler`, even if it
is deprecated since `1.23.0` (and will be removed in `1.26.0`).

Now with the policy, trying to instantiate an
`autoscaling/v2beta2/HorizontalPodAutoscaler` resource that is already
deprecated will result in its rejection:

```
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: autoscaling/v2beta2
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: php-apache
spec:
  scaleTargetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: php-apache
  minReplicas: 1
  maxReplicas: 10
EOF

Warning: autoscaling/v2beta2 HorizontalPodAutoscaler is deprecated in v1.23+, unavailable in v1.26+; use autoscaling/v2 HorizontalPodAutoscaler
Error from server: error when creating "STDIN":
admission webhook "clusterwide-my-deprecated-api-versions-policy.kubewarden.admission" denied the request:
autoscaling/v2beta2 HorizontalPodAutoscaler cannot be used. It has been deprecated starting from 1.23.0. It has been removed starting from 1.26.0. It has been replaced by autoscaling/v2.
```
