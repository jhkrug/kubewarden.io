Today we're glad to announce the release of Kubewarden 1.12.

This release focuses on optimizations and high availability, both oriented to
production.

## Optimizing Gatekeeper policies

The previous [1.11
release](https://www.kubewarden.io/blog/2024/03/kubewarden-1-11-release/)
featured lots of optimizations for
[context aware policies](https://docs.kubewarden.io/next/reference/spec/context-aware-policies).

The 1.12 release provides a further optimization for Gatekeeper policies that
access Kubernetes resources. This optimization provides an extra 55%
performance boost for these policies.

The benefits of this optimization are particularly noticeable when a huge number
of Kubernetes resources are accessed by a Gatekeeper policy.

For example, a policy that access Pod resources, will see a reduced evaluation time
on big clusters where hundreds of Pod objects are defined.


## Increasing deployment reliability

Due to community requests for increasing deployment availability of
Kubewarden, from 1.12 each [PolicyServer
spec](https://docs.kubewarden.io/next/reference/CRDs#policyserverspec) has
additional fields to configure policy-server Deployment behavior in clusters:

- `spec.minAvailable` or `spec.maxUnavailable`: Configure the number of
  policy-server replicas available. The controller creates
  [PodDisruptionBudget](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/disruptions/#pod-disruption-budgets) objects as needed for these settings.
- `spec.affinity`: [Affinity and anti-affinity rules](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/assign-pod-node/#affinity-and-anti-affinity) of the policy-server Pods.
- `spec.limits` and `spec.requests`: Set the [resource limits and requests](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/#resource-requests-and-limits-of-pod-and-container) (cpu,
  memory, and other resources) of each container of the policy-server Pods.

These new PolicyServer spec fields are now also available for the default
PolicyServer installed via the `kubewarden-defaults` chart.

Head over to [the docs
page](https://docs.kubewarden.io/howtos/policy-servers/production-deployments)
for more information on the PolicyServer spec, and have a look at the new
fields in the kubewarden-defaults chart.

## Bug fixes and small features

Several community-prompted bugfixes and features were tackled. The most notable
being:

- Sigstore signature verification in `kwctl` and `policy-server` works again as
  usual. Previously, the Sigstore Rust crate had a regression introduced by the
  release of TUF spec v1.0.32, and Kubewarden failed-closed and reported "Image
  verification failed: missing signatures" even if there were valid signatures.
  This is now fixed.
- Verifying policies from private registries with access credentials now works
  in `kwctl` and `policy-server`. As usual, set your authentication data in a
  `~/docker/config.json` file for `kwctl`, and see [the
  docs](https://docs.kubewarden.io/howtos/policy-servers/private-registry) on
  creating the Secret for the PolicyServer.
- `policy-server` binaries now have a new feature flag that allows them to
  continue even on policy initialization errors. This provides users with a UX
  where they don't need to check policy-server error logs and each of the
  policies if some are failing (with misconfigured policy settings for example).
  This feature is currently alpha as it needs more polishing. Because of that, this is disabled by default. Users can set the
  env var `KUBEWARDEN_CONTINUE_ON_ERRORS` for policy-server if they wish to
  enable this feature flag.
- The `kubewarden-controller` chart now exposes a value for configuring the
  controller log level.

## Documentation improvements
